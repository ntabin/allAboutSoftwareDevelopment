# Antipattern
Set of solutions to a problem that seems right but lead to trouble in the long run.

## Golden Hammer
Creating a one solution to solve all problems. It is like _If all you have is a hammer, then everything else looks like a nail_. 

_Oh you have to chop down a wood, you use a **hammer**._

_Oh you have to gather all the leaves in one place, you use a **hammer**._

Can you imagine how bad and requiring so much effort. If you could just use the right tool for the job?

Why does this happen? Have you ever heard a manager say _"Please use this **insert specific tech stack/tool**"_?
Maybe that person has success on a specific project using that tool or the company have spend a lot of resources polishing that tool.
Sometimes the problem doesn't need the feature of that tool.
Then if that tool is forced, we have a **golden hammer**

What to do to prevent it? Simple **use the right tool for the job**. Have evidence that **Tool A** is better to be used in this specific problem than **Tool B**.
Experience can be a factor but it is harder to acquire.

## Dead Code
Unused code that everybody is afraid of. This usually happens when there is a bunch of requirement changes that a developer is required to do. What happens is that the developer leaves the unused code behind.
As time passes, developers doesn't know whether some parts of the programs used that code that made them afraid to interact with
