# Service Consumer Patterns

# Composite Front-End
This pattern is almost the same with Composite Design Pattern except it is in the UI or Frontend. And this UI also wants to display data from multiple services. The basic idea is that the UI must be composable and each UI component is service specific. In some Javascript Framework like Angular, this is super as it is built with components in mind. And we can make each compoenent communicate to a specific service that we want without much coupling
