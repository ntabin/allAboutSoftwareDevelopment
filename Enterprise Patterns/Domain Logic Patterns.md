# Domain Logic Patterns

## Transaction Script

By definition, transaction script organizes business logic by procedures wherein each procedure handles a single request from the presentation.

Basically transaction script is:
* super simple as you have to write the procedure in one location
* just write the procedures sequentially and you are all set.
* Transaction script is best in non complext procedures. 
* because of this, transactione may be viewed as not OOP but rather Procedural.
