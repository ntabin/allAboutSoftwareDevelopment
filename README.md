# Coding Principles

### KISS (Keep it Super Simple)
  Also known as Keet it super simple or Keep it simply simple.
  
  Write code as simple as possible. 
  
  `if(payingCustomer)` is easier to read than `if(customer.paymentCustomerId != null)`
  
  For function make it super simple, if the name of the function is `save()`, it should only save.
  
  Use existing libraries/tools to simplify a task. Do not reinvent the wheel unless it's necessary.
  
  For variable names avoid hungarian notation for example:
  `isAuthorized` is easier to read than `m_isAuthorized`
