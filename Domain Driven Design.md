# Domain Driven Design

First what is _**Domain**_. Domain is what the software we are creating for or what the customer need or want. This is what we need to understand.

For example we have a Bank, then the services of the domain can be **loans, accounts and assets**.

We also need to know _**Domain Expert**_. Well obviously this are people expert in the specific domain. As from the example above, it can be **Loan Officer or a Lawyer**.
These so called _**Domain Expert**_ can also be the one who will use our software. This is important as a software developer so that we fully understand what it is that we have to do.

We also have **Ubiquitous language** which is simply the language used by **Domain Experts** and software developers to fully understand the domain. This language unites team members.
The terms used by **Domain Experts** must be the same to what the software developers will use.

**Domain Driven Design** is trying to mimic your software on what it feels like in the real world. The **Domain Expert** and software developers uses **Ubiquitous language** to understand each other.
