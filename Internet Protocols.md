# Domain Name System (DNS)
In simple terms, it is the phonebook of I.P (Internet Protocol) addresses with their equivalent domain names. 
Web browsers interact in I.P addresses. DNS translates domain names to I.P addresses and we as users don't need to memorize those I.P Addresses.
For example in your web browser, you navigate to [www.example.com](https://www.example.com), the browser will look up in your specified DNS to know what is the equivalent in I.P Address. The browser then make a request to that I.P Address.

# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Internet standard for email, supported by many servers. 
SMTP simplifies the in and out movement of email across networks. 
The SMTP breaks the email into parts so that it will distinguish the different parts of email including the sender, receiver and message and to know which email server to send it.
SMTP can only send text.

# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
An internet standard protocol for collecting information on managed network devices devices for monitoring or changing the behavior. 
SNMP talks to your network devices all day getting information like bytes, packets and even errors transmitted and received within the network.
It works by thouroughly send Packet Data Units (PDU) to devices within your network.
By this, all Administrators can track data within the network.

# Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
Much like a post office, it receives and holds emails until someone downloads it to their email program then it will automatically deleted by POP3 on email server.
