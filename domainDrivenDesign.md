# Domain Driven Design

First what is _**Domain**_. Domain is what the software we are creating for or what the customer need or want. This is what we need to understand.

For example we have a Bank, then the services of the domain can be **loans, accounts and assets**.

We also need to know _**Domain Expert**_. Well obviously this are people expert in the specific domain. As from the example above, it can be **Loan Officer or a Lawyer**.
These so called _**Domain Expert**_ can also be the one who will use our software. This is important as a software developer so that we fully understand what it is that we have to do.

Domain Driven Design is trying to mimic your software on what it feels like in the real world.
